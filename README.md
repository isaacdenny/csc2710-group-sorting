# csc2710-group-sorting
The group sorting project for CSC2710

## 1. Delegation - Get sorts done for next lab

- Bubble*
- Merge*
- Selection 
- Insertion*
- Exchange
- Heap*
- Quick

---

- Josh - Insertion
- Kevin - Merge
- Graham - Bubble
- Isaac - Heap
- Jimi - Compile all other sorts into project

## 2. Design Project Structure & Flow - TODO - Next time we meet

### How can this be used?

### How will we present?

- Show code?
- Show results?

### What is the most important part of the code to focus on?


## 3. Dataset Building - TODO - Next time we meet

- What datasets? (need 4)

- [ ] Almost sorted
- [ ] Randomly distributed
- [ ] Reverse sorted
- [ ] Many Duplicates

## 4. Questions To Answer In Presentation

1. A description of your teams’ approach to the assignment. Your presentation should present your
results and summarize what your team learned about the various sorting.
2. A presentation and walkthrough of the code that was written by the team.
3. A final analysis of the success of the team’s approach and results. If the team’s program failed why did
it do so. In computer science, it is quite normal for an attempted solution to fail to fully achieved the
targeted goals. Some of the most successful software ever created has been built on the foundation of a
few previous failed attempts where teams tried a solution and failed, but they gained valuable knowledge
into why a certain approach will not work
